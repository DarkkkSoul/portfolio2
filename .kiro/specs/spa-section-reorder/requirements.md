# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reordering the sections of an existing Single Page Application (SPA) portfolio website to improve user experience and content flow. The current layout presents information in a specific order, but the user wants to reorganize sections to better showcase their work and create a more logical progression for visitors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio website visitor, I want to see projects immediately after the about section, so that I can quickly understand the developer's capabilities through their work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls down from the about section THEN the system SHALL display the projects section next
2. WHEN the projects section is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing project data and functionality
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL preserve the current responsive design for all screen sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio website owner, I want the skills section to appear after projects, so that visitors can see my technical abilities in context after viewing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects section THEN the system SHALL display the skills section immediately below it
2. WHEN the skills section is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing skill components and styling
3. WHEN the skills section loads THEN the system SHALL preserve any interactive elements or animations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio website visitor, I want to see the bento-style design section after skills, so that I can appreciate the developer's design aesthetic and creativity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls past the skills section THEN the system SHALL display the bento section next
2. WHEN the bento section renders THEN the system SHALL maintain both desktop (Bento) and mobile (SmBento) responsive components
3. WHEN the bento section loads THEN the system SHALL preserve the Rengoku reference and audio functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a potential client, I want the hire me section to appear last, so that after seeing all the developer's work and skills, I can easily find contact information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches the end of the content sections THEN the system SHALL display the hire me section before the footer
2. WHEN the hire me section is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing content and styling
3. WHEN the page structure is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure the footer remains at the bottom

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the code, I want all existing functionality preserved during the reordering, so that no features are broken in the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections are reordered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing GSAP animations and classes
2. WHEN the layout changes THEN the system SHALL preserve all component imports and dependencies
3. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements continue to function properly
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing backdrop blur modal functionality
