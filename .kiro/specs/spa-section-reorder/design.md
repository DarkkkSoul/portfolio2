# Design Document

## Overview

The SPA section reordering involves restructuring the JSX layout in the main App.jsx component to change the visual flow of content sections. This is a straightforward DOM restructuring task that maintains all existing components, styling, and functionality while simply changing the order in which sections appear on the page.

## Architecture

The current architecture uses a single-file component approach where all sections are rendered within the main App component. The reordering will be accomplished by moving JSX blocks within the existing component structure without affecting:

- Component imports and dependencies
- State management (ModalContext)
- GSAP animation setup
- Responsive design logic
- Individual component functionality

## Components and Interfaces

### Affected Components
- **App.jsx**: Main component containing all sections - requires JSX reordering
- **ProjectComponent**: No changes required
- **Bento/SmBento**: No changes required  
- **Skills**: No changes required

### Section Mapping
```
Current Order → New Order
1. About → 1. About (unchanged position)
2. Skills → 3. Skills (move down 1 position)
3. Todo npm → 2. Todo npm (move up 1 position) 
4. Hire me → 5. Hire me (move down 2 positions)
5. Rengoku text → 4. Rengoku text (move up 1 position)
6. Bento → 4. Bento (move up 2 positions)
7. Projects → 2. Projects (move up 5 positions)
8. Footer → 6. Footer (unchanged relative position)
```

### Responsive Considerations
- Desktop and mobile layouts use conditional rendering for Bento/SmBento components
- All sections maintain existing responsive classes and breakpoints
- Grid layouts in projects section remain unchanged

## Data Models

No data model changes are required. All existing data structures remain intact:
- `projects` array import and mapping
- Component props and state
- Context providers and consumers

## Error Handling

### Potential Issues and Mitigation
1. **GSAP Animation Conflicts**: All existing `gsap-animate` classes will be preserved to maintain animation timing
2. **Component Dependencies**: Import statements and component references remain unchanged
3. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Existing Tailwind classes and conditional rendering logic preserved

### Validation Strategy
- Verify all sections render in correct order
- Confirm responsive behavior on mobile and desktop
- Test GSAP animations still trigger properly
- Validate modal backdrop functionality remains intact

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Visual Verification**: Confirm new section order matches requirements
2. **Responsive Testing**: Test layout on mobile (sm:) and desktop breakpoints
3. **Interactive Elements**: 
   - Copy button functionality for npm command
   - Audio playback for Rengoku sound effect
   - Project component links and demos
   - Modal backdrop behavior
4. **Animation Testing**: Verify GSAP animations still work for all sections
5. **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure layout works across different browsers

### Component Integration Testing
- Verify ProjectComponent grid layout and individual project cards
- Test Skills component rendering and styling
- Confirm Bento/SmBento conditional rendering based on screen size
- Validate all imported components render without errors

## Implementation Notes

### Code Structure Preservation
- Maintain all existing CSS classes and Tailwind utilities
- Preserve component prop passing and data flow
- Keep all existing imports and exports
- Maintain JSX formatting and indentation consistency

### Performance Considerations
- No performance impact expected as this is purely a layout change
- Component rendering order may slightly affect paint timing but should be negligible
- GSAP animations may need slight timing adjustments if visual flow changes significantly
